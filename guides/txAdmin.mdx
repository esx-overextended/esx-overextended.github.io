This Guide will show the quick and easy way to setup a FiveM server using txAdmin!

:::tip
Make sure you have successfully installed and setup the [database](../guides/database) before continuing!

## Starting Notes

- Make sure to register a free licence key at [Cfx.re Keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/)

- When asked for an IP use the _Public IPv4 Address_ of the machine that you are setting up your FiveM server on

## Step 1: Installing The Server

- Head to the [Artifact Download page](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/)
- Click the download with the highest number - [see here](https://i.imgur.com/OMcCVIW.png)
- Open the `server.zip` you just downloaded and extract it anywhere you want to store it. (We'll pick `C:\FXServer\server` as an example for this tutorial)
- Open the extracted folder, it should look like [this](https://docs.fivem.net/server-setup/windows-step-5.png)

## Step 2: Starting Your Server

- In the extacted folder, find `FXserver.exe` and double click it
- This site should open in your browser; if it does not, open your browser and goto `localhost:40120`
- Make sure the PIN is filled in and then press `Link Account`.
- You will then be prompted to log into your [Cfx.re](https://forum.cfx.re/) account, click `Yes, Allow` once done.
- You will then be promted to create a backup password, incase CFX.re auth does not work.

## Step 3: Setting Up Your Server

- Assuming you are now on a menu similar to [this](https://docs.fivem.net/server-setup/windows-step2-5.png), click `Next`
- From here choose `Remote URL Template`.
- Then in the input box that appears, enter the line below:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esx-overextended/txAdminRecipe/main/recipe.yaml
```

- Once entered, press `Save` and then head to the `Recipe Deployer`!

## Step 4: Deploying Your Server

- The recipe deployer will take you to an overview of the recipe selected.
- By default, these should be correct, so scroll to the bottom and press `Next`.
- It will then ask for your [Cfx.re licence key](https://keymaster.fivem.net/).
- Once entered, press `Run Recipe`.
- This will start downloading and installing the resource files into the server!
- once it has finished, click `Save & Run Server`.
- you will then be taken to the txAdmin dashboard, and can load into your server!

_P.S. Keep in mind first time loading of the server takes more as it has to configure the resources, so let the server do its job and read/load the resources properly..._
