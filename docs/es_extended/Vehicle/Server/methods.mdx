## xVehicle.getCoords

Gets the vehicle's coordinates and heading

```lua
xVehicle.getCoords(vector)
```

- vector?: `boolean` (if true, it returns the vehicle coords as vector4, else it returns the coords as table)
- @return `vector4` or `table`

## xVehicle.set

Sets the vehicle's **non-persistant** data for key to the given value which will be removes on vehicle deletion. Similar to statebag data.

```lua
xVehicle.set(key, value)
```

- key: `string`
- value: `any`

## xVehicle.get

Gets a value from the vehicles's **non-persistant** data, or omit the argument to get all data.

```lua
xVehicle.get(key)
```

- key?: `string` (if omitted, it returns all data)
- @return `any`

## xVehicle.setMetadata

Sets the vehicle's **persistant** data for key to the given value which will be saved on vehicle deletion. Unlike statebag data.

```lua
xVehicle.setMetadata(key, value, subValue)
```

- key: `string`
- value?: `string` or `number` or `table`
- subValue?: `any`
- @return `boolean` (indicating whether the action was successful or not)

## xVehicle.getMetadata

Gets a value from the vehicles's **persistant** data, or omit the argument to get all data.

```lua
xVehicle.getMetadata(key, subKey)
```

- key?: `string` (if omitted, it returns all data)
- subKey?: `any`
- @return `any`

## xVehicle.delete

Removes/despawns the vehicle from the game world, optionally removes its entry from database.

```lua
xVehicle.delete(removeFromDb)
```

- removeFromDb?: `boolean` (delete the entry from database as well or no - defaults to **false** if omitted)

## xVehicle.setStored

Updates the vehicle's `stored` property and optionally despawns it.

```lua
xVehicle.setStored(value, despawn)
```

- value?: `boolean`
- despawn?: `boolean` (remove the vehicle entity from the game world as well or no - defaults to **false** if omitted)

## xVehicle.setOwner

Updates the vehicle's owner, matching a xPlayer's `identifier` or nil to set it as unowned.

```lua
xVehicle.setOwner(newOwner)
```

- newOwner?: `string`

## xVehicle.setGroup

Updates the vehicle's group, which can be used for garage restrictions, unowned group vehicles, etc.

```lua
xVehicle.setGroup(newGroup)
```

- newGroup?: `string`

## xVehicle.setPlate

Sets the vehicle's plate, used in the database to ensure uniqueness. Does not necessarily match the vehicle's plate property (i.e. fake plates).  
_Plate is always formatted to **8** characters._

```lua
xVehicle.setPlate(newPlate)
```

- newPlate: `string`
